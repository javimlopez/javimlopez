# Hi, I'm Javi Mota :D!
## Current Studies
Right now, I am studying Software Engineering at the University of Malaga through the SICUE Programme with the University of Almeria, which is my university.
I’m currently learning Functional Programming through the Haskell Language and the use of Data Structures such as trees, graphs, sets, lists... both in Haskell and Java.
In addition, I am learning different project management techniques such as agile methodologies like Scrum, Kanban and the PMBOK standard through an online shop software project using Wordpress.
